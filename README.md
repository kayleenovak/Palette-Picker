# Palette-Picker

## About
  Palette Picker was a project for Turing School of Software and Design's mod 4 requirements. Pallete Picker allows the user to generate a random color palette, and save that palette. The user can lock colors, which will persist even if the user generates a new palette. The palette can be saved to a project that the user created. The saved palettes and projects are saved to a database and displayed on the right side of the screen for the user to see. If the user clicks on the colors of a saved palette, that palette will then display on the large palette.
  
Palette Picker is deployed on Heroku: [Palette Picker](https://pick-a-palette.herokuapp.com/).
